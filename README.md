Technologies Used: 
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- jQuery

API Used:
- Open Brewery DB (Rapid API)
- BreweryDB (Attempted)


Approach:
- Search for breweries based on state.
- Filter results based on city and by brewery type.
- Display selected brewery information.
- Provide the user with a usable link to the selected brewery website.


Issues:
- Database only provides 20 breweries per state, even on the website which allows you to access the db with example code.
- Design did not turn out as responsive as it should have.
- Did not have time to get rid of redundent cities in the filtering options.
- For some reason using 'VA' does not work when searching through the database but every other state abbreviation does work.
