Technologies Used:
    This project utilizes the Open Brewery DB from Rapid API.  This database is focused on breweries throughout the U.S. and lists breweries by each state.  The API allows breweries to be searched by state and keyword.

Approach:
    This project was originally suppose to utilize BreweryDB which hosted a lot more information about breweries and even included information about beer and beer making supplies.  This would have produced a project with much less limitations and was originally suppose to search for breweries based on address, location, or zip code.  But this API was very difficult to use and I was never able to pull any information from it.  So the app's approach is to now find breweries based on state.

Issues:
    - Database only provides 20 breweries per state, even on the website which allows you to access the db with example code.
    - Design did not turn out as responsive as it should have.
    - Did not have time to get rid of redundent cities in the filtering options.
    - For some reason using 'VA' does not work when searching through the database but every other state abbreviation does work.
